# Amethyst.host
**amethyst.host** is a hosting service, providing premium Minecraft servers for 32% of our competitors price, with better specs & features. We strive to provide the cheapest but most exclusive feel to our service, that's why we're prioritizing customer satisfaction over profits.

## Monthly Expenses
We pay **€32.39** for each of our nodes, and at a full node we get back **€48**. Don't believe us? Our nodes are 60GB of RAM each, to prevent overselling and we sell each GB of RAM for **€0.80/GB**, feel free to do the Math.

**Input: €32.39 + €8.27 = €40.66**  
**Output: ~48EUR**  
**Difference: ≈€7.34 / node**  

We strive to be transparent about our income, technicalities, and team - That's why this Repository is public.

## Backend deploying
To start **amethyst.host**, do the following: 
  1. `npm i` to install dependencies
  2. `npm run build` to build backend source
  3. `npm run start` to start the backend up

## Modules
Amethyst backend is fully modular, which means you can have it do a **LOT** of stuff. Pros:
  1. Safe uptime (if one module fails - the rest will work fine)
  2. High extensibility
  3. Easy to write

To make a module, make a `.ts` file in `src/modules`

**Keep in mind!** If you want to split a module into multiple files, make its **own folder**.
