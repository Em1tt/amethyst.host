**amethyst.host** is a hosting service, providing premium Minecraft servers for 32% of our competitors price, with better specs & features. 

We strive to provide the cheapest but most exclusive feel to our service, that's why we're prioritizing customer satisfaction over profits.

## Monthly Expenses
We pay **€32.39** for each of our nodes, and at a full node we get back **€48**. *Don't believe us?* Our nodes are **60GB** of RAM each, to prevent overselling and we sell each GB of RAM for **€0.80/GB**

We strive to be transparent about our income, technicalities, and team - **that's why this repository is public.**

## Backend deploying
To start **amethyst.host**, do the following: 
1. `npm i` to install dependencies
1. `npm run build` to build backend source
1. `npm run start` to start the backend up

## Modules
Amethyst backend is fully modular, which means you can have it do a **LOT** of stuff. Pros:
* Safe uptime (if one module fails - the rest will work fine)
* High extensibility
* Easy to write

To make a module, make a `.ts` file in `src/modules`

**Keep in mind!** If you want to split a module into multiple files, make its **own folder**.
