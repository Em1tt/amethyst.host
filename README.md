## Code

### Starting up the backend
Do this in the order specified.
**This backend has scripts built only for Linux machines as of now.**
```shell
npm i  # install dependencies
npm run build # build backend source
npm run start # start the backend up  
```

### Additional commands
```shell
npm run nstart # start in a dev environment, with start traces
npm run update # pull from the GitHub repo, build and restart the process
npm run lint # lint ts files
```

## Modules
### Info
Our backend is extremely flexible for use in any production, whether big or small. It works on a modular base, which brings the following pros:
* Safe uptime - When a module crashes, all the other work just fine.
* Easy to write
* High extensibility

### Creating a module

To make a module, make a `.ts` file in `src/modules`

**Keep in mind!** If you want to split a module into multiple files, make its **own folder**.
