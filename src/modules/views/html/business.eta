      We operate on tight profit margins, so you can pay less for essential hosting services. Yes, we admit it. It might be crazy to operate 
      at such small profit margins, but we want to prove to the world it's possible to own a transparent, independent, open-source, low-profit
      hosting company.
      While we can't guarantee all our plans will come true, we'll do our best to at least <i>try as hard as we can</i>.</p>
